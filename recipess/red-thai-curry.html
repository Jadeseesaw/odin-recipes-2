        <h3> *Description:</h3>
        <p> This dish was requested by my friend who i shall name spagetti in the middle of class too btw 
            where i was working on this program. So its spicy , has chicken and welll tastes amazing.
        </p>
        <p> I would make a fair guess that this curry is one of the most popular curries in the world putting
            aside well the other asian  curries and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that it was originated
            from well.... Thailand . duh. 
            other that that enjoy cooking  byeeeee

            <li> Heat oil in a large heavy based skillet over medium high heat.</li>
            <li> Add curry paste and Extras (if using jar paste) and cook for about 2 minutes so it “dries out” </li>

            <li> Add coconut milk, lime leaves, sugar and fish sauce. Stir, then add chicken.</li>

            <li> Do a taste test. Add more fish sauce (or even shrimp paste) to add more saltiness, sugar for sweetness.</li>
            <li> Add pumpkin and beans, stir. Cook for 3 minutes or until pumpkin is just cooked through and Sauce is thickened</li>
            <li> Remove from heat. Stir through a handful of Thai basil leaves.</li>
